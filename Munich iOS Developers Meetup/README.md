This repository contains the slides and code examples used for the XCoordinator presentation of the Munich iOS Developers Meetup at October 25, 2019. You can find the slides ([Slides.pdf](https://github.com/quickbirdstudios/XCoordinator-Talks/blob/master/Munich%20iOS%20Developers%20Meetup/Slides.pdf)) of the presentation as well as an example project using XCoordinator with the MVC architecture pattern.

There are 2 folders to help you with the different stages of the presentation:
- **_prepresentation_** contains the state the project is in when the presentation started, you can find a rundown of what changed during the presentation on the slides following the first exercise
- **_midpresentation_** contains the state of the project when the presentation starts to mention more advanced features of XCoordinator
