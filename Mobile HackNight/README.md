# Mobile HackNight: XCoordinator Workshop

This repository contains the slides and code examples used for the XCoordinator workshop of the first “Mobile HackNight” at QuickBird Studios. You can find the slides ([Slides.pdf](https://github.com/quickbirdstudios/XCoordinator-Talks/blob/master/Mobile%20HackNight/Slides.pdf)) of the presentation as well as an example project using XCoordinator with the MVC architecture pattern.

- **_master_** contains the state of the project when the participants were free to explore XCoordinator, guided by some provided tasks
- **_solution_** contains an example solution to the exercises provided to the participants of the workshop
