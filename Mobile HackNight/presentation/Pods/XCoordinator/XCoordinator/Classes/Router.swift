/// The Router protocol is used to abstract the transition-type specific characteristics of a Coordinator.
///
/// A Router can trigger routes, which lead to transitions being executed. In constrast to the Coordinator protocol,
/// the router does not specify a TransitionType and can therefore be used in the form of an AnyRouter to reduce a coordinator's
/// capabilities to the triggering of routes. This may especially be useful in viewModels when using them in different contexts.
